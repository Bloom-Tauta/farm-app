# phase-3-sinatra-project

This project is about a Farm App and was done by Bloom Tauta.
It comprises of the back end and the frontend.
The Backend was coded in  Ruby and Sinatra to store my data.
On the Frontend I used React which is JavaScript framework to create a good UI/UX.

### Run bundle install in backend directory folder fold to install dependancies.
To start the backend server cd into backend (cd backend). Then run (bundle exec rake server). THe server will run on port http://localhost:9292

### Run npm install in the farm-projects directory in frontend folder to install dependancies.
To start the fronted server cd into frontend, then cd into farm-projects, (cd frontend, cd farm-projects). Then run npm start. Ther server will run on port http://localhost:3000

# DELIVERABLES
This app comprises of the Backend and Frontend.
For the Backend we have a Sinatra API that uses ActiveRecord to access and persist data in the database.
The React Frontend then interacts with the database via the API.

### Requirements
1. Use Active Record to interact with a database.
2. Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
3. Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
4. Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
5. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
6. Include an ERD diagram to show how the database is relating to the tables.


### Tips
Postman was used for testing the endpoints
Binding.pry was used for debugging purposes in Ruby.
